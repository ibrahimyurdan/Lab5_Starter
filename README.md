## Check Your Understanding

1. Would you use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application? Why or why not?
   - No i would not use a unit test for the whole message feature. This feature involves many parts working together (typing sending receiving displaying) and needs to test how these parts interact with each other. Unit tests are better for testing small separate pieces of code.

2. Would you use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application? Why or why not?
   - Yes i would use a unit test for the max message length feature. This is a simple rule that checks if a message is too long (over 80 characters). Its a single small piece of code that can be testd by itself without needing to test other parts of the application.
